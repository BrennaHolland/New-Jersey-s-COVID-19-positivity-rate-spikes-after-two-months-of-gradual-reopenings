    <p>Nov. 13, Fort Lee, NJ — At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April, New Jersey was seeing over 4,000 new cases and 400 deaths each day.</p>

    <p>“At that point, everything except labor and delivery was dedicated to COVID patients. We were bursting at the seams. We tripled the size of our ICU. We had 40 people on ventilators at one time,” Stephen Brunnquell,
      MD, head
      of the COVID
      taskforce at Englewood Health, said.</p>

    <p>As spring melted into summer, the Garden State successfully flattened the curve through a combination of indoor mask-mandates, the expansion of outdoor dining and limits on indoor gatherings.</p>

    <p>The four months that followed were a much-needed reprieve from the panic-stricken energy of spring—new cases were down to 300-a-day and there were many days with no reported deaths from COVID-19.</p>
    <p>Now, after two months of gradual reopenings, including indoor dining and religious services, as well as music venues and sporting events, NJ’s COVID positivity rate looks disturbingly similar to that of April and May.</p>
    <p>On Thursday, Governor Murphy implemented new curfews on indoor dining and announced an imediate halt to all indoor and inter-state sports.</p>
    <p>"We have to shake off the pandemic fatigue that we all feel. I feel it, as well. But we have to get back into the mindset that helped us crush the curve in the spring," Gov. Murphy said at Thursday's press conference.</p>
